============

WoW MITM Protocol Analyzer is a project developed around 2006-2007 and has aided the development of some open-source (and not)
WoW Servers. It is basically a MITM protocol analyzer.

Please note that this software is highly dependant on WoW version and is most certainly useless at present.
